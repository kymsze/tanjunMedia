                  At pitch stage, we provided a strategic approach nicknamed ‘nuke’em’, which looked at multiple UGC options for the audience; these options also fell within two categories, high commitment and low commitment. This was the preferred approach and we got to work.The National Lottery Good Cause social channels are not of a size or reach to pull-off what was needed. This required the leverage of a digital influencer…a big influencer! That person was the UK’s biggest youtuber, KSI.

                  We kicked off the campaign by creating a self aware ‘walk & talk’ launch piece with Gold Medalist Amy Williams. This was built around the multiple UGC that Team GB fans could create to demonstrate their Superfan status.
